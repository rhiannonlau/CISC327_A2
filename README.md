# Project Description
This project is a rapid front-end prototype of a task management software given the following description:\
The aim here is to create an online task management system. This system shall allow users to create,
manage, and track tasks and projects. Users can create individual tasks, organize them into projects, set
priorities and deadlines, assign tasks to team members, and monitor task progress throughout the
completion of the project\
\
For this assignment, the goal was to create a front-end that follows good coding practices but is not correct as it is not supposed to be tested yet.
